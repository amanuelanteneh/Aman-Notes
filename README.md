# Amanuel's Notes

These are notes that I have made during my self study of topics in the areas of physics, computer science, statistic and mathematics. This website was largely inspired by Aaron Reding's website for the the [**Bayesian Statistics course**](https://areding.github.io/6420-pymc/intro.html) at Georgia Tech.
