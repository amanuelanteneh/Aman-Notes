    "However there's a problem here. If we were to compute this by first computing $x^y$ directly we would end up with very large numbers. For example if $x$ and $y$ are 20-bit numbers, and since the smallest 20-bit number is $2^{19}$, then the quantity $x^y$ is *at least* $(2^{19})^{2^{19}}=2^{19(524288)}$ which is huge. Note that when I say \"smallest 20-bit number\" I mean the smallest number that you need 20-bits to represent. So if $x$ and $y$ are $n$-bit numbers then $x^y$ is in general a $(2^{n-1})^{2^{n-1}}$-bit number. This is not optimal since it would require use to use many more bits in our program than may be necessary which in turn worsens the time & space complexity. Is there a clever way to compute $x^y \\bmod N$ while keeping the number of bits need on the same order as the number of bits needed to represent $x,y$ and $N$? \n",

    "We could instead try this: first suppose we compute $x \\bmod N = z_1$. Now lets compute $x^2 \\bmod N$. Can we do this without actually computing $x^2$ explicitly? The answer is yes! \n",
    "First recall that any integer $x$ that we want to divide by another integer $N$ that is not $0$ we can write $x$ as $x=qN+r$ where $q,r \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Also recall that for this integer we have, by definition, $x\\bmod N=r$. Now what about $x^2 \\bmod N$? Well if we use the same expression for $x$ in terms of $q,N$ and $r$ we get \n",

    "So to compute $x^y\\bmod N$ we can first compute $z_1=x\\bmod N$ and then to compute $x^2 \\bmod N$ we compute $z_2=(z_1x)\\bmod N$. And then to compute $x^3 \\bmod N$ we just compute $z_3=(z_2x)\\bmod N$ and so on until we have computed $x^y\\bmod N$. \n",
    "Doing it this way we only ever have to compute the modulo $N$ of numbers that are at most equal to $Nx$ in the case that one of the intermediate modulo operations yields $z_i=N$. There is a huge downside with this method however. It is easy to see that we will need to compute exactly $y-1$ multiplications to compute $x^y \\bmod N$ with this method which at first seems great; the time complexity is linear in $y$, $O(y)$, so whats the big deal? Well recall that the time complexity of multiplying two $n$-bit numbers is $O(n^2)$ and the complexity of division is also $O(n^2)$ {cite:p}`dasgupta2008algorithms` so each intermediate step has complexity $O(n^2+n^2)=O(n^2)$ since we must multiply $z_i$ with $x$ as well as divide that product by $N$ to compute the modulo $N$. However we do this $y-1$ times and since $y$ is an $n$-bit number it is at most $2^n$ so our overall time complexity is $O(2^nn^2)$ which is exponential in the input size (number of bits needed to represent $x,y$ and $N$).\n",
