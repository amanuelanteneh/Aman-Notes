# Introduction

I never really had an big interest in statistics until I took the graduate Bayesian statistics and High-dimensional statistics courses at Georgia Tech during my MS in computer science. Since then I've been interested in learning more about these topics and statistics and modeling more broadly. These are notes I've taken in my self-study of these topics.
