How can we specify the state of qubit $A$ now? In this case we are working with *incomplete* information of the new system (qubit $A$). This is because it is *entangled* with qubit $B$ and thus it is not possible to *fully* describe the state of qubit $A$ without making reference to the state of qubit $B$. The reduced density matrix of qubit $A$, which again results in performing a partial trace of the qubit $B$, would therefore be a mixed state.\n",

Therefore the crucial distinction between these two states is that one is a *quantum superposition* while the other is not. This illustrates the fundamental difference I was trying to get at earlier.
