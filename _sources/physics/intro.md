# Introduction
I will be assuming that the reader has and undergraduate level understanding of quantum mechanics but I may go over some fundamentals when appropriate. 

## Conventions
When working with the position and momentum (quadrature) operators, $q$ and $p$ respectively, we will define them as 

$$
q = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (a+ a^\dagger), \quad p = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}i}(a - a^\dagger)
$$

solving for $\hbar$ using the canonical commutation relation $[q,p] = i\hbar$ we get $\hbar=1$.
