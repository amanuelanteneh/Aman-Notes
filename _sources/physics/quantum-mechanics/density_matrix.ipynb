    "In quantum mechanics the state of a system can be specified by a column vector in a complex Hilbert space called a ket and denoted in Dirac notation as \n",

    "There is also another way of denoting the state of the system called the density matrix (also called the density operator) which is defined as $\\rho = \\ket{\\psi}\\bra{\\psi}$. The unitary evolution of the state is now given by the von Neumann equation (also known as the Liouville–von Neumann equation) {cite:p}`benenti2019principles`\n",

    "which we know is an entangled state. Suppose we were to take qubit $B$ and simply \"throw it away\" or ignore it (and assume it does not interact with anything moving forward) and only consider qubit $A$, this is equivalent to taking the partial trace of the system over qubit $B$ which is covered in the next page. How can we specicy the state of qubit $A$ now? In this case we are working with *incomplete* information of the new system (qubit $A$) because since it is entangled with qubit $B$ and thus it is not possible to desribe the state of  \n",

    "Mixed states: classical ignorance due to unwanted interactions between the quantum system and the environment.\n",
    "A question you might have is: What exactly is the difference between the pure state $\\ket{\\psi}= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\ket{0}+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\ket{1}$ and the mixed state $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}\\ket{0}\\bra{0} + \\frac{1}{2}\\ket{1}\\bra{1}$? This was something that really confused me when I first learned about the density matrix formalism and it's actually a another great way of explaining the difference between the pure and mixed states. \n",
    "This question came up for me because I was thinking about it from a measurement point of view. For example if you were to measure both state in the $\\{\\ket{0}, \\ket{1}\\}$ basis you would get one of the two basis states with equal probability i.e. $\\frac{1}{2}$. \n",

    "We can see that while the occupation probabilities of the basis states $\\{\\ket{0}, \\ket{1}\\}$, given by the diagonals, for both systems are the same the pure state has non-zero *off-diagonal* elements. This is because the off-diagonal elements $\\rho_{ij}$ of the density matrix correspond to interference (superposition) between the basis states $\\ket{i}$ and $\\ket{j}$ {cite:p}`benenti2019principles`. Therefore the crucial distinction between these two states is that one is a *quantum superposition* while the other is not. This illustrates the fundamental difference I was trying to get at earlier. In the case of the pure state we have *complete* information about it's state "
