    "which we know is an entangled state. Suppose we were to take qubit $B$ and simply \"throw it away\" or ignore it (and assume it does not interact with anything moving forward) and only consider qubit $A, this is equivalent to taking the partial trace of the system over qubit $B$ which is covered in the next page. How can we specicy the state of qubit $A$ now? In this case we are working with *incomplete* information of the new system (qubit $A$) because since it is entangled with qubit $B$ and thus is correlated with it\n",
