    "of measuring the number of photons in a system thereby projecting the quantum state into an eigen state of the number operator $N = a^\\dagger a$ which are the Fock states {cite:p}`kok2010introduction`. These detectors were long sought after in the experimental realm and have in recent years been experimentally realized using the technology of superconducting transition edge sensors (TES) {cite:p}`lita2008counting`.
