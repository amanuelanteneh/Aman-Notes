    "Dynamic programming is similar to the divide and conquer approach except that the subproblems overlap i.e. the subproblems share the same subsubproblems. This method of solving problems typically is used in optimization problems, particularly optimal control problems, and was originally developed by Richard E. Bellman who is also famous for developing the closely related Bellman equation which is at the core of reinforcement learning {cite:p}`sutton2018reinforcement`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key strategy is to store the solutions, in a hashtable for example, to the subproblems and then reuse the solution later if the same subproblem is encountered rather than recomputing the solution {cite:p}`cormen2022introduction`. Computing the $n$-th Fibonacci number is a common example problem that illustrates this."

The caveat here is that there maybe certain ways to cut the rod such that we actually get more profit by selling the individually cut pieces instead of selling the uncut rod. \n",
