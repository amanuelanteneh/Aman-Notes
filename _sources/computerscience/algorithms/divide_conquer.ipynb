    "Divide & conquer is a method for designing algorithms that solve problems by breaking the problem into smaller subproblems and then solving those smaller problems by dividing further until some base case is reached when the problem is small enough. Once the base case is reached we solve that subproblem and then use that solution to solve the larger problem by combining it with solutions to the other smaller subproblems we have solved. Merge sort is a nice example of this that we will go over. As you can probably guess from this description divide & conquer is very closely tied to the concept of recursion.\n"
