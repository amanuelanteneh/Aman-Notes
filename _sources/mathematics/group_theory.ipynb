    "In mathematics a group $G := \\{S,*\\}$ consists of a set $S$ (such as the the set of all integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ ,  and a binary operation $*$ (such as addition $+$) where the following 4 criteria are met {cite:p}`gallian2021contemporary`: \n",

    "Closure: For any \\(a,b \\in G \\) we have \\( a*b \\in G\\). So the result of doing the binary operation on any 2 elements from the group will return an element that is also in the group.\n",
